# Product Requirements Document - constructon

**Author:** Lmr
**Date:** 2025-12-14

## Executive Summary

**constructon** is a digital platform for a modern villa construction company bringing Western-style architecture and smart home technology to Zimbabwe. The website serves as the primary customer acquisition and engagement channel, targeting affluent Zimbabweans locally and in the diaspora who want quality, transparency, and modern design in their dream home.

### Vision

To become Zimbabwe's premier modern villa builder by combining international design standards, smart home technology, and unprecedented transparency — making the dream of owning a contemporary home accessible and trustworthy for customers both locally and abroad.

### The Problem We Solve

1. **Trust Gap**: Zimbabwean customers (especially diaspora) fear being scammed by contractors, receiving poor quality, or having projects abandoned mid-build
2. **Design Gap**: No local builder offers truly modern, Western-style villa designs with contemporary aesthetics
3. **Technology Gap**: Smart home features are virtually non-existent in the local construction market
4. **Transparency Gap**: Most builders hide pricing and provide poor communication during construction

| Local High-Achiever | Successful professionals wanting to stand out | Modern design & smart tech |

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Thabo Ndlovu — The Diaspora Returner

Thabo is a 43-year-old senior software engineer living in Birmingham, UK. He left Zimbabwe 15 years ago and dreams of building a "home base" for family visits and eventual retirement. He's been burned before — lost $12,000 to a local builder through a cousin — and is deeply skeptical.

One evening, scrolling a "Zimbabweans in UK" Facebook group, he sees a stunning photo of a completed smart villa. Curious, he clicks through to constructon.co.zw on his phone.

He's immediately struck by the professional photography and — crucially — the clear pricing displayed upfront. No "call for quote" games. He browses the Executive Villa, sees the smart home features, and shows his wife. Together they use the Financing Calculator and realize they could afford the Signature Villa.

The trust-building elements seal it: team video introductions, completed project gallery, client testimonials, and the "constructon Verified" badge. He clicks WhatsApp and receives a response within 2 minutes, including information about the Diaspora Build Program with weekly video updates via the Build Tracker Dashboard.

**Journey Requirements:**
- Hero images that stop the scroll
- Upfront pricing on all villa plans
- Financing calculator with monthly payments
- Team profiles with video introductions
- Client testimonials and completed projects gallery
- WhatsApp instant response capability
- Diaspora-specific program information
- Build Tracker Dashboard feature

### Journey 2: Chipo Makoni — The Local High-Achiever

Chipo is a 38-year-old marketing agency owner in Harare. Successful and style-conscious, she's embarrassed that her current home doesn't reflect her achievements. She's traveled internationally and knows what modern architecture looks like — she wants THAT in Zimbabwe.

A Saturday morning Instagram ad catches her eye: a stunning villa with the caption "Your neighbors will ask for our number." She clicks through and is immediately impressed — the website itself is modern and sleek, matching the aesthetic she craves.

She filters by "Executive" tier and discovers smart home technology is included — voice control, automated security, app-controlled climate. She screenshots it for her group chat. The Villa Configurator hooks her: she can customize finishes and see prices update live.

She submits an inquiry and receives a phone call within an hour. A site visit is scheduled for the following week.

**Journey Requirements:**
- Instagram-quality photography throughout
- Sleek, modern website design
- Filter/browse by villa tier
- Smart home features prominently displayed
- Villa Configurator with live pricing updates
- Completed local projects gallery
- Fast lead response (phone call, not just message)
- Site visit scheduling capability

### Journey 3: Tino & Rudo — The Young Power Couple

Tino (31, accountant) and Rudo (29, marketing manager) are newlyweds tired of paying $650/month rent for someone else's mortgage. They've looked at existing houses but everything in their budget is old or poorly located. They've almost given up on owning a stylish first home.

A TikTok video changes everything: a young couple walking through their new modern starter villa. Rudo finds constructon.co.zw and shows Tino.

His first reaction: "There's no way we can afford this." Then Rudo finds the Starter Villa tier — from $95,000. The Financing Calculator shows that with their $15,000 savings, they'd pay $1,100/month — only $450 more than rent, and they'd OWN it.

A promotional banner seals it: "$0 deposit on selected Starter Villas until March 2025." They message on WhatsApp and receive a reassuring reply within 3 minutes, including a First-Time Builder Guide and invitation to a free weekend webinar.

**Journey Requirements:**
- Clear "Starter Villa" entry-point tier
- Prominent financing calculator
- Affordable monthly payment messaging
- First-time builder resources (FAQ, guides, webinar)
- Young couple testimonials
- Limited-time promotional offers
- Land partnership information
- Reassuring, low-pressure communication tone

### Journey 4: Mr. Kenneth Moyo — The Investor

Mr. Moyo (52) is a serial entrepreneur with aging rental properties that don't command premium rent. His accountant advises diversifying into quality property. He also wants something his diaspora children can use when visiting.

At a business lunch, a friend shows off his new constructon villa — a successful Airbnb investment. Mr. Moyo gets the name and searches from his office.

He skips the pretty pictures and looks for credibility: team credentials, completed projects, testimonials from business people he recognizes. Satisfied, he finds the investment section with the Rental Yield Calculator showing 12-16% annual returns.

The hook: the "Turnkey Investment Package" — constructon handles everything from build to furnishing to property management connection. He calls directly (not WhatsApp) and is in a meeting within 24 hours, reviewing ROI projections.

**Journey Requirements:**
- Strong credibility signals (team, credentials, completed projects)
- Investment-focused content section
- Rental yield calculator
- Turnkey package information
- Property management partnerships
- ROI projections and data
- Direct phone contact option
- Professional, business-focused communication

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Market Innovation — First Mover Advantage

constructon challenges fundamental assumptions about the Zimbabwean construction market:

| Assumption Challenged | constructon's Answer |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "You can't get modern, Western-quality villas in Zimbabwe" | International-standard designs with contemporary aesthetics |
| "Local builders can't be trusted with diaspora money" | Build Tracker Dashboard with weekly video updates |
| "Smart home technology is only for developed markets" | Smart home features included as standard |

**Competitive Landscape:** Few competitors currently offer this combination of modern design, smart technology, and transparent pricing in Zimbabwe. constructon has first-mover advantage in this niche.

### The Real Moat — Trust as a Feature

**Key Insight:** The true innovation isn't smart homes — it's **trust as a product feature**. Competitors can copy villa designs and smart home packages. They cannot easily replicate a trust ecosystem built on radical transparency.

**Defensible Advantages:**
| Advantage | Why It's Hard to Copy |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Build Tracker Dashboard | Requires operational discipline, not just technology |
| Weekly video updates culture | Embedded process, not a feature toggle |
| Diaspora-specific program | Deep understanding of overseas customer psychology |
| First testimonials & referrals | Network effects compound over time |
| Brand reputation for transparency | Takes years to build, seconds to lose |

### Trust Innovation — The Diaspora Solution

The Build Tracker Dashboard represents a genuine innovation for the local market:

**Problem Solved:** Diaspora customers fear being scammed when building remotely. Previous bad experiences with local builders have created deep distrust.

**Innovation:** Real-time transparency system including:
- Weekly video progress updates
- Milestone celebration notifications
- Photo galleries at each build stage
- Dedicated project manager communication

**Honesty Architecture — Communicating Setbacks:**

Trust isn't built by showing only good news. It's built by how you handle bad news.

| Situation | Communication Protocol |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Minor delay (weather, materials) | Proactive message within 24 hours with new timeline |
| Major issue (structural, supplier failure) | Video call with client, written action plan, compensation options |
| Cost overrun risk | Early warning at 10% risk threshold, not after the fact |
| No visible progress week | Still send update: "Here's what happened behind the scenes" |

**Validation Approach:**
- Pilot with first 3-5 diaspora clients
- Measure response rate to updates
- Track referral rate from satisfied clients
- Collect video testimonials for social proof

### Product Innovation — Smart Homes as Standard

While competitors treat smart home technology as a luxury add-on, constructon makes it standard:

**Included Features:**
- Voice-controlled lighting
- Automated security gates
- App-controlled climate
- Whole-home audio ready

**Supply Chain Validation:**
- Identify 2-3 smart home component suppliers
- Validate pricing and lead times before launch
- Stock critical components to avoid project delays
- Have backup suppliers for each key component

**Fallback Strategy:** If market adoption is slower than expected, smart home features can be repositioned as optional upgrade tiers, starting with security basics (automated gates, smart locks) and expanding based on demand.

### Innovation Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Execution — delivering quality at scale | High | High | Start with limited builds, perfect process before scaling |
| Market readiness — customers may not value smart tech | Medium | Medium | Educate through content marketing, offer tiered packages |
| Supply chain — smart home components availability | Medium | High | Multiple suppliers, stock key components |
| Competitor imitation | Medium | Medium | Build trust moat faster than they can copy |

**Primary Risk:** Execution is the biggest innovation risk. The promise of Western-quality smart villas must be delivered flawlessly on early builds to establish credibility.

### Recovery Plan — The "Kill Switch"

If Build #1 encounters serious problems:

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Quality issues discovered | Full transparency with client, fix at own cost, document the recovery story |
| Major delay (60+ days) | Compensation package, weekly executive updates, client becomes "founding partner" with benefits |
| Complete failure | Full refund + compensation, honest public post-mortem, rebuild trust through accountability |

**Brand Recovery Strategy:**
1. Never hide problems — own them publicly
2. Over-compensate affected clients
3. Document lessons learned transparently
4. Use recovery story as proof of integrity
5. "How we fixed our first mistake" becomes a trust asset
